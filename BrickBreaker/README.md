# BrickBreaker

This is a simple game inspired by BreakOut! and Arkanoid.

Box2D  is  included   in  `Box2D/`.  The  license  for   Box2D  is  in
`Box2D/License.txt`.

You may  need to set the  Base SDK; on  my laptop I've got  4.2.1, but
3.1.2 should be fine too.

## Rules

There's a paddle, a ball, and bricks. What more to say?

Well, actually,  there is  more to say.  It's what  makes BrickBreaker
unique.

- You have to hit the ball with some force; it doesn't just bounce off.
- The more  bricks you hit in a  row, the more score  per brick you'll
  get. If you hit multiple bricks without the ball touching the paddle
  again, you get extra points that keep adding on until you die.
- The paddle is tiny!
- The more  bricks you  hit in a  row, the  more the ball  will bounce
  around, too, up to a certain point. This should be a challenge! :)
- Your 'brick  value' will get  reset to 10  if you lose a  life. That
  happens  when  you  let  the   ball  through.  Don't  let  the  ball
  through. Got it?

And really, I think that's about it.
